# fpga_link1

Software for Linux/macOS and maybe other POSIX systems.

This is a c++ library that implements a PC - FPGA data link using: 
- a serial port UART-8N1
- a SPI (FTDI HighSpeed Cable)
- a TCP connection

The first version will include support only for UART-8N1. The development board used is a Spartan-3 Board from Digilent Inc. (RETIRED now).
